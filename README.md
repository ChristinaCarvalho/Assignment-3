## How to use the app
This app supports conversions between the following units: centimeters (cm), meters (m), feet (ft), and inches (in).

The user first inputs their initial value.
Then the user inputs the abbreviated units of that initial value.
Finally, the user inputs the abbreviated units for what they want to convert that initial value to.
The converted value is calculated and shown.

If the user wants to exit the app, they can type -1 when the program asks for the initial value.
If the user enters an unsupported unit, the program will tell the user so they can try again.

## Example
A user wants to convert 1 centimeter to meters.

Input:
1
cm
m

Output:
Conversion from 1 cm to m is 0.01 m
